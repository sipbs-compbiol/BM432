# BM432

Welcome to the BM432 computational biology repository for 2022!

This repository contains materials to support workshop sessions on:

- Project management, including:
  - data management
  - reference management

- Data analysis, including:
  - data formats
  - public data resources
  - introductory statistics

- Data presentation, including
  - visualisation
  - reporting of statistical outputs
  - Open Science

These workshops are presented as part of BM432: Being a Biomolecular Scientist 4, at the University of Strathclyde.

The material you are viewing relates to the 2022-2023 presentation of the course, and was prepared by:

- [Dr Leighton Pritchard](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/pritchardleightondr/)
- [Dr Morgan Feeney](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/morgan-feeney)

NOTE: The 2022-2023 presentation differs from that in 2021-2022 as that the workshop sessions on data analysis are not being run. However, we continue to make the materials for this session available as they may be a useful and valuable reference for students as they work on their projects.

## How do I use this repository?

If you are a student on BM432, you should not *need* to use this repository, but we make it available in the spirit of open science.

As tutors, we use the code and materials in this repository to generate:

1. standalone HTML files that can be used with MyPlace
2. `Shiny` webapps that can be run by students on their own machines, or at `rstudio.org`

The material is written in `R` using `R Markdown`, and to work with or generate all the materials, we recommend that you install and use `RStudio`.

### Using this repository on your own machine
